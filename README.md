# Portfolio

### This is the private repository for the Porfolio of Eric Musa (Me!).

I ran into issues with resource leaks on AWS Lightsail due to JavaScript errors I created as I began expanding the website. I migrated all the remote code and statics to this repository and will continue developing locally, periodically pushing changes to the remote repo once they're bug-tested.

This portfolio is hosted on a AWS Lightsail instance running a `LAMP`+`Django` stack (the **"P"** in `LAMP` is for `Python` and the **"M"** is technically for `SQLite3`, not `MySQL`)

### Current features to develop include:
1. Add `Feature` model
2. Dynamic, interactive slideshow for pictures (with 3 pictures)
3. Expanding the slideshow to 6 pictures
4. Add Roadmap tab listing features
5. Create styled timeline ordered by feature dates
